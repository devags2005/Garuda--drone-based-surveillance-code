## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Surveillance Settings

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Input Type | Select between camera feed or video file | Camera |
| Video Source | Camera index or path to video file | 0 (primary webcam) |
| Telegram Bot Token | API token for Telegram notifications | Empty (notifications disabled) |
| Telegram Chat ID | Recipient ID for Telegram notifications | Empty (notifications disabled) |
| Start Time | Beginning of surveillance time window | 00:00:00 (midnight) |
| End Time | End of surveillance time window | 23:59:59 (end of day) |
| Playback Speed | Speed multiplier for video playback | 1.0 (normal speed) |
| Target FPS | Desired frames per second for processing | 15 FPS |

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced users, the following parameters can be modified in the `app.py` file:

- **Detection Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence score for person detection (default: 0.4)
- **Detection Interval**: Number of frames between detection operations (default: every 3rd frame)
- **Notification Cooldown**: Minimum time between Telegram notifications (default: 10 seconds)
- **Frame Resize Dimensions**: Resolution for processing frames (default: 640px width, maintaining aspect ratio)

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Setting Up Surveillance

1. **Configure Input Source**:
   - Select "Camera" to use a connected webcam or camera
   - Select "Video File" to upload and analyze a pre-recorded video

2. **Set Up Notifications** (Optional):
   - Create a Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and obtain the API token
   - Determine your Telegram Chat ID (use [userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
   - Enter both values in the respective fields

3. **Configure Monitoring Schedule**:
   - Set the "Start Time" and "End Time" to define when surveillance should be active
   - The system will only process video and send alerts during this time window

4. **Adjust Performance Settings** (Optional):
   - Modify "Playback Speed" for video files (higher values process video faster)
   - Set "Target FPS" to balance between processing load and detection accuracy

5. **Start Surveillance**:
   - Click the "Start Surveillance" button to begin monitoring
   - The video feed will display in real-time with detection overlays

### Monitoring and Control

- **Status Indicator**: Shows whether the system is currently online or offline
- **Current Time Display**: Shows the current time for reference against the scheduled window
- **Video Feed**: Displays the processed video with person detection bounding boxes
- **Stop Button**: Immediately halts surveillance and returns the system to standby mode

### Receiving Alerts

When a person is detected in the video feed:

1. The individual will be highlighted with a green bounding box in the video feed
2. If Telegram notifications are configured, you will receive:
   - An image capture of the detected person
   - A caption indicating "Person detected!"
   - Timestamp information embedded in the image

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Video Processing Pipeline

1. **Frame Acquisition**:
   - Custom `VideoCapture` class manages frame retrieval from the source
   - Implements frame buffering to handle variable frame rates
   - Controls playback speed for video file analysis

2. **Pre-processing**:
   - Frames are resized to optimize processing performance
   - Frame skipping is applied based on target FPS settings

3. **Object Detection**:
   - YOLOv8 neural network processes frames to identify people
   - Detection runs on a subset of frames to balance performance
   - Confidence filtering removes low-probability detections

4. **Post-processing**:
   - Detected persons are annotated with bounding boxes and labels
   - Timestamp information is overlaid on each frame
   - Processed frames are encoded to JPEG format for streaming

5. **Alert Generation**:
   - Person detections trigger the notification system
   - Rate limiting prevents alert flooding
   - Asynchronous processing ensures continuous monitoring

### YOLOv8 Integration

GARUDA leverages the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model, which offers:

- Fast inference times suitable for real-time applications
- High accuracy in detecting persons in various poses and lighting conditions
- Robust performance across different video qualities
- Low false positive rates compared to earlier detection models

The system uses the "nano" variant (yolov8n.pt) by default, balancing speed and accuracy, but can be configured to use larger models for higher precision.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

GARUDA implements several optimization strategies to ensure smooth operation across different hardware configurations:

1. **Adaptive Frame Processing**:
   - Intelligent frame skipping based on system capabilities
   - Processing resolution adjustment to maintain performance
   - Detection frequency tuning to balance CPU/GPU usage

2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**:
   - Threaded video capture to prevent I/O blocking
   - Asynchronous notification delivery to maintain processing throughput
   - Event-based frame handling to reduce unnecessary computations

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Frame buffer control to prevent memory leaks
   - Explicit garbage collection during long-running sessions
   - Resource cleanup on surveillance termination

4. **Processing Throttling**:
   - Target FPS limiting to prevent system overload
   - Time-based sleep intervals to regulate processing rate
   - Cooldown periods for resource-intensive operations

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Camera not detected | Driver issues or incorrect camera index | Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2) or reinstall camera drivers |
| Slow detection performance | Insufficient system resources | Lower the target FPS, reduce processing resolution, or use a more powerful machine |
| Telegram notifications not working | Incorrect token or chat ID | Verify credentials and ensure the bot has been started by the recipient |
| High CPU usage | Processing too many frames | Increase frame skipping, lower target FPS, or reduce video resolution |
| Video file not playing | Unsupported codec or format | Convert video to MP4 with H.264 encoding |
| "No module found" error | Missing dependencies | Ensure all required packages are installed via pip |

### Logging and Debugging

For advanced troubleshooting, enable debug mode in Flask:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, threaded=True)
```

This will provide detailed error messages and stack traces in the console output.
